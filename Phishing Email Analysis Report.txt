Email Details
Message ID: IIapLBL.05868.931+=phishing@pot@firiri.shop

Created At: 8/23/2023, 2:27:24 AM GMT+5:30 (Delivered after 41 minutes)

From: Europa park V.3 (otto-newsletter@newsletter.otto.de)

To: phishing@pot

Subject: Nehmen Sie an der kurzen Umfrage für den Europa-Park teil und erhalten Sie vier kostenlose Eintrittskarten!

Phishing Indicators Found
1. Sender Information
The “From” address does not match the organization name.

Email used: otto-newsletter@newsletter.otto.de (appears official but is suspicious when combined with other indicators).

2. Authentication Results
SPF: Pass (but IP is unknown)

DKIM: None

DMARC: Fail

3. Suspicious Links
Image redirect link: https://granilee.com/100fbd3ab1503f31800/300

The link returns a 200 OK status, meaning the website is active, but it shows no actual content.

4. Urgent or Threatening Language
Examples found in the email:

“Final attempt”

“Don’t respond today”

“Cancel the shipment”

5. Poor Grammar and Formatting
Salutation: “Hello phishing@pot,” – very unprofessional and not standard for legitimate businesses.

Awkward phrasing: “We’ve prepared for free shipping.”

Threatening tone: “If you don’t respond today, we will cancel the shipment…”

Unusual formatting: “>> Confirm Address <<<” – legitimate emails typically use proper buttons or links without these symbols.

Summary of Risk
This email is highly likely to be a phishing attempt because of:

Domain spoofing

Failed DMARC authentication

Suspicious external link

Use of urgent language

Poor grammar and unprofessional formatting
