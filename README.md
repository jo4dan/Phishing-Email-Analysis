## Overview

This project analyzes a sample phishing email to identify key indicators such as spoofed sender, suspicious links, failed authentication checks, urgent language, and grammatical errors. The goal is to raise awareness of phishing tactics and demonstrate basic email threat analysis techniques.

## Contents

* `phishing_email.txt` – Raw phishing email sample
* `report.md` – Detailed analysis of phishing indicators
* `header_analysis.png` – Screenshot of email header analysis
* `screenshots/` – Additional process screenshots (optional)

## Tools Used

## Steps Performed

1. Obtained a sample phishing email.
2. Analyzed the sender details for spoofing and mismatches.
3. Checked email headers for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results.
4. Hovered over links to identify mismatched or suspicious URLs.
5. Noted urgent or manipulative language in the email body.
6. Checked for grammatical and formatting errors.
7. Summarized all phishing indicators in a structured report.

## Key Findings
